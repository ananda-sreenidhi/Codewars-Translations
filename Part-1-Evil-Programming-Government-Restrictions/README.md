 # Translation: Part 1: Evil Programming Government Restrictions (5 kyu)

## Kata Description
The evil programming government has banned the use of numbers.
Your task, if you choose to accept it is to return numbers, without using numbers.

### Problems:   
- You can't use number literals in your source code. 
- You can't use the length property directly in your code.   

### Goal:
- You have to return 'I can write numbers like, 1, 2, 3.'

Can you help me fix the function?
